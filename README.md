# ðŸš€ Machine Learning Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Learning Journey** repository!  
This repo documents my progress in learning, experimenting, and applying ML techniques to real-world datasets. Each folder contains a separate project with its own README and notebook/code files.  

---

##  Tools & Libraries  
- Python   
- scikit-learn  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly   
- Streamlit

##  My Learning Goals  
- Strengthen ML foundations through hands-on projects  
- Learn both **EDA** and **Model Building**  
- Practice explaining ML concepts in simple words  
- Build a portfolio of projects for GitHub showcase

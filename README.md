# üöÄ Machine Learning Learning Journey  

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Learning Journey** repository!  
This repo documents my progress in learning, experimenting, and applying ML techniques to real-world datasets. Each folder contains a separate project with its own README and notebook/code files.

## üìÇ Projects  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ü´Ä Heart Disease EDA  
- **Goal**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization  
  - Risk factor identification (cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, lifestyle)  
  - Correlation heatmap & insights  
- **Future Work**: Build ML models for classification.

###  Earthquake Prediction & Analysis  
- **Goal**: Predict earthquake magnitude and aftershock occurrence using ML.  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Regression (predict magnitude)  
  - Classification (predict aftershock occurrence)  
  - Clustering (KMeans & DBSCAN for seismic pattern analysis)  
  - Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for visualization  
- **Results**:  
  - KMeans performed better for structured clusters  
  - DBSCAN gave valuable spatial insights

##  Tools & Libraries  
- Python   
- scikit-learn  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly   
- Streamlit

##  My Learning Goals  
- Strengthen ML foundations through hands-on projects  
- Learn both **EDA** and **Model Building**  
- Practice explaining ML concepts in simple words  
- Build a portfolio of projects for GitHub showcase
